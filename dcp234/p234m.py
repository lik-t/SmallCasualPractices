# Problem #234 [Hard]: This problem was asked by Microsoft.
# Recall that the minimum spanning tree is the subset of edges of a three
# that connect all its vertices with the smallest possible total edge
# weight. Given an an undirected graph with weighted edges, compute the
# maximum weight spanning tree.

# Ideas?
# 1. how to represent a undirected graph?
# 2. how to represent a tree?
# 3. review the graph theory!
# 4. -----------------------
# 5. what is minimum spanning tree?

# This is already finished.
